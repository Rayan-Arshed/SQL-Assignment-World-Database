# SQL Assignment World Database

## Overview
A project based in MySQL Workbench, where a database of countries and their details was loaded, and specific queries were answered relating to the dataset, testing my ability to query data. This assignment tested my knowledge of SQL queries, being comfortable working with MySQL Workbench, and understanding database relationships. Marked Grade: Distinction

## Project Goals
The goals of this project were to understand relational database design, practice and refine my SQL query abilities, and as a personal goal, to create complex queries that take nuance of the theoretical client's asks into account, as well as include queries that could manipulate data to make different calculated fields for a query. The results from my queries would answer and satisfy the client's asks ideally.

## Tools and Technologies Used
### SQL
- Using AS to give fields aliases for easier understanding
- Using WHERE to filter data, including wild cards in my experessions for searching
- Using ORDER BY to sort data
- Using LIMIT to restrict the returned values to a subset
- Using AND for multiple WHERE conditions
- Using JOIN ON to query seperate tables together

### MySQL Workbench
- Understanding how it is used and functions
- Reverse engineering Entity Relationship Diagrams

## Strong Points of my Work
- Creating detailed and complex queries that include numerical calculations and data manipulation
- Detailed, step-by-step documentation of my processes behind developing my queries
- Showing knowledge of the understanding of SQL queries and relational databases

## Repo Sections
- PDF version of my report
- SQL script file to create and initialize the database used
- SQL script file which contains my queries and comments
